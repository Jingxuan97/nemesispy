These are example Nemesis files for calculating a disc averaged spectrum of an exoplanet using correlated-k. The parameters are of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, and the spectral unit is expressed as a ratio to the host star flux. The atmospheric condition is assumed to be homogeneous across the disc. Five quadrature points are used for integrating over the zenith angle. Only planetary emission is included (no solar reflection), and the atmosphere is dust free. k-tables, cia tables and stellar spectrum are included in the folder.
