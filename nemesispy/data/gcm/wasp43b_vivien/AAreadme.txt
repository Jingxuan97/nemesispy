Data from a model atmosphere of WASP-43b calculated using SPARC/MITgcm
(Showman et al. 2009), based on the set-up of Parmentier et al. (2016).
The particular model was used in Irwin et al. (2020). The contents of files
are described below.

wasp43b_gcm_vivien.txt
    Raw GCM data. The first line says that the model is defined on a
    64 longitude x 32 latitude grid, followed by the 64 longitudes and
    32 latitudes. Substellar point is defined at 0 degree longitude.
    Line 19 says that the model has 53 pressurre grid points, followed
    by the 53 pressures in bar (line 20 - 28). The rest of the file follow
    the format (T,CO2_VMR,H2_VMR,He_VMR,CH4_VMR,CO_VMR,H2O_VMR), varying
    in the order pressure -> latitude -> longitude.
    The file is parsed to more usable formats in process_wasp43b_gcm_vivien.

wasp43b_gcm_vivien_mod.txt
    Same as wasp43b_gcm_vivien.txt but with gas VMRs set to global averages.

process_wasp43b_gcm_vivien.py
    Routines that parse the wasp43b_gcm_vivien.txt and
    wasp43b_gcm_vivien_mod.txt data files into more manageable Python objects.
    You can access the data using the following command
    from process_wasp43b_gcm_vivien import (
        nlon,nlat,xlon,xlat,npv,pv,\
        tmap,h2omap,comap,co2map,ch4map,hemap,h2map,vmrmap,\
        tmap_mod,h2omap_mod,comap_mod,co2map_mod,ch4map_mod,\
        hemap_mod,h2map_mod,vmrmap_mod,phase_grid,\
        kevin_phase_by_wave,kevin_wave_by_phase,\
        pat_phase_by_wave,pat_wave_by_phase)
        xlon,xlat,pv specifiy the longitude, latitude and pressure grid of
        the gcm, and each of the maps are defined on the
        longitude x latitude x pressurre grid.
