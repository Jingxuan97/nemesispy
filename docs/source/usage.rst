------------

To use NemesisPy, first clone the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Jingxuan97/nemesispy)
to your computer. Then, navigate to the directory where you have saved the
repository and run the command

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install .

This will install the package and make it available to use in your Python environment.
In order to install the package but still make it editable, run instead the command

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install . --editable

NemesisPy can also by direcly installed from PyPI
(https://pypi.org/project/nemesispy/) by running the "pip install nemesispy" command.
However, we strongly recommend installing the package from the GitHub repository
to make sure that you have the latest version of the package.
